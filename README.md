# bipedal

The bipedal parts for joi.

## In here

The form is partitioned by each of the analogous humanesque parts:

* [head](/head/README.md)
* [arms](/arms/README.md)
* [trunk](/trunk/README.md)
* [legs](/legs/README.md)

Cleaned obnoxious file extension names by:

`rename 's/\.STL$/\.stl/' *.STL`

## The totality of effort
